Every [dbt project](/docs/build/projects) needs a `dbt_project.yml` file â€” this is how dbt knows a directory is a dbt project. It also contains important information that tells dbt how to operate your project.

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.4">

By default, dbt will look for `dbt_project.yml` in your current working directory and its parents, but you can set a different directory using the `--project-dir` flag.

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.5">

By default, dbt will look for `dbt_project.yml` in your current working directory and its parents, but you can set a different directory using the `--project-dir` flag or the `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable.

Starting from dbt v1.5 and higher, you can specify your dbt Cloud project ID in the `dbt_project.yml` file using `project-id` under the `dbt-cloud` config. To find your project ID, check your dbt Cloud project URL, such as `https://cloud.getdbt.com/11/projects/123456`, where the project ID is `123456`.

The following is a list of all available configurations in the `dbt_project.yml` file.
